Supp. Protest at 5.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t\\tAlthough we sustained AOC’s protest based on the agency’s evaluation of the awardee’s proposal under the solicitation’s staffing evaluation factor, we dismissed AOC’s argument challenging the acceptability of CenturyLink’s use of OTU-4 fiber, finding that it raised an untimely challenge to the Library’s response set forth under amendment 4 to the solicitation, expressly permitting an OTU-4 fiber solution.\\xa0 AOC Connect, LLC, supra, at 5.\\xa0 To the extent AOC believed that RFP Amendment No. 4 created an inconsistency with other aspects of the solicitation’s requirements, AOC was required to protest the inconsistency prior to the date for receipt of proposals.\\xa0 Id.\\xa0 In this regard, a patent ambiguity exists where a solicitation contains an obvious, gross, or glaring error (e.g., where solicitation provisions appear inconsistent on their face).\\xa0 Umicore Optical Materials USA, Inc., B-415546, B-415546.2, Jan. 19, 2018, 2018 CPD ¶ 89 at 7.\\xa0 A patent ambiguity must be protested prior to the next closing time for the submission of proposals in order to be considered timely.\\xa0 Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. §\\xa021.2(a)(1); see e.g., Pitney Bowes, Inc., B-294868, B-294868.2, Jan. 4, 2005, 2005 CPD ¶ 10 at 5.\\xa0 Because AOC knew the Library was willing to accept an OTU-4 solution prior to receipt of proposals, its post-award protest challenging the Library’s acceptance of CenturyLink’s OTU-4 solution was dismissed as untimely filed.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t\\tIn its request for reconsideration, AOC contends we misunderstood its protest and “incorrectly concluded that AOC’s protest focused on the RFP specifications,” when instead it “was focused on [the Library’s] improper evaluation of CenturyLink’s initial and ‘final’ technical proposal.”\\xa0 Request for Recon. at 2.\\xa0 In essence, the protester contends we incorrectly construed its protest argument to be that no OTU-4 solution could be technically acceptable, when it actually was arguing that CenturyLink’s particular OTU-4 solution was technically unacceptable.\\xa0 \\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t\\tUnder our Bid Protest Regulations, to prevail on a request for reconsideration the requesting party must show either that our decision contains errors of fact or law, or present information not considered previously that warrants the decision’s reversal or modification.\\xa0 4 C.F.R. § 21.14(a).\\xa0 The repetition of arguments made during our consideration of the original protest and disagreement with our decision do not meet this standard.\\xa0 Epsilon Sys.
