(RCI) protests the award of a contract to NCS Pearson, Inc. under request for proposals (RFP) No. DTTS59-02-R-00440, issued by the Department of Transportation\\'s (DOT) Transportation Administrative Service Center (TASC), on behalf of the newly created Transportation Security Administration (TSA), to obtain a wide range of human resources services to establish and support the TSA. RCI challenges as unreasonable the agency\\'s evaluation of proposals and source selection decisions.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe deny the protests.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn the aftermath of the terrorist hijackings and crashes of passenger aircraft on September 11, 2001, the Congress passed, and the President signed, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), Pub. L.<br/>\\n\\tNo. 107-71, 115 Stat. 597 et seq. (2001), on November 19, 2001. The<br/>\\n\\tATSA established the TSA as a new agency within the DOT and tasked it<br/>\\n\\twith security responsibilities for all modes of transportation<br/>\\n\\toverseen by the DOT and other related activities. As part of its<br/>\\n\\tmission to ensure aviation security, the TSA was made responsible for<br/>\\n\\tpassenger security, including the qualification, recruitment and<br/>\\n\\texamination of a federal workforce responsible for all phases of<br/>\\n\\tsecurity screening at various security checkpoints throughout<br/>\\n\\tcommercial airports. To fulfill this mission, the TSA is required to<br/>\\n\\thire and deploy more than 30,000 federal security screeners and<br/>\\n\\tthousands of federal security managers, federal law enforcement<br/>\\n\\tofficers, and intelligence and support personnel to screen all<br/>\\n\\tpassengers and property at 429 domestic airports by November 19, 2002.<br/>\\n\\tId. Sec. 110(c).</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe TASC, which was delegated authority to conduct procurements on<br/>\\n\\tbehalf of the TSA, issued this solicitation on January 18, 2002 to<br/>\\n\\tacquire contractor support to develop, implement and execute an<br/>\\n\\toverarching qualification, assessment, staffing, and placement system<br/>\\n\\tand to provide on-going human resources services for airport security<br/>\\n\\tscreeners, law enforcement officers and other TSA personnel in<br/>\\n\\tcompliance with federal law, regulation and policy to allow the TSA to<br/>\\n\\tmeet or exceed the dated mandates and other legislative requirements<br/>\\n\\tof the ATSA. RFP Sec. C.1.0.B. The RFP\\'s scope of work was broadly<br/>\\n\\twritten to encompass a wide range of human resources services divided<br/>\\n\\tinto four separate modules, three of which are at issue here: Module<br/>\\n\\t1, \"Posting and Applicant Intake for Security Screener and Law<br/>\\n\\tEnforcement Job Applications and Additional Postings as Required\";<br/>\\n\\tModule 3, \"Candidate Selection\"; and Module 4, \"Day-to-Day Servicing.\"<br/>\\n\\tRFP Sec. C.2.0.G.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe agency planned to award a single contract for each module, and to<br/>\\n\\tevaluate each module independently of the other modules, but<br/>\\n\\tcontractors were not limited to one award. Award was to be made,<br/>\\n\\twithout conducting discussions, to the offeror whose proposal provided<br/>\\n\\tthe best value. The agency planned to award time-and-material and<br/>\\n\\tlabor hour contracts with a cost line item for other direct costs.<br/>\\n\\tPerformance was to commence upon award and continue through December<br/>\\n\\t31, 2002.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tProposals would first be evaluated against minimum requirements for<br/>\\n\\teach module on a go/no-go basis. Proposals meeting the minimum<br/>\\n\\trequirements would then be evaluated to ascertain which represented<br/>\\n\\tthe best value to the government against technical approach and price<br/>\\n\\tevaluation factors; technical factors were to outweigh price. RFP<br/>\\n\\tSec. M.A.2. The technical approach evaluation factor was comprised<br/>\\n\\tof two subfactors, past performance and management/technical approach.<br/>\\n\\tPast performance was more important than management/technical<br/>\\n\\tapproach. Id. For each module proposed, offerors were required to<br/>\\n\\tprovide a total labor price based on total proposed hours, a proposed<br/>\\n\\tmix of labor categories, hour per category comprising the total hours,<br/>\\n\\tloaded hourly rates per category, and other direct costs. The agency<br/>\\n\\tplanned to conduct a price reasonableness evaluation. RFP Sec. M.C.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTwenty-five offerors submitted proposals by the February 1 closing<br/>\\n\\tdate. Proposals not deemed grossly deficient were referred to a<br/>\\n\\ttechnical evaluation team, which first evaluated them against the<br/>\\n\\tRFP\\'s minimum requirements, and then evaluated those proposals meeting<br/>\\n\\tthe minimum requirements under the solicitation\\'s past performance and<br/>\\n\\tmanagement/technical approach subfactors.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWith at least eight offerors submitting proposals for each module, the<br/>\\n\\tagency concluded that there was adequate price competition and that<br/>\\n\\tthe requirement for price reasonableness was satisfied. Source<br/>\\n\\tSelection Official (SSO) Decision at 7; Federal Acquisition Regulation<br/>\\n\\t(FAR) Sec. 15.404-1(b)(2)(i). The RFP\\'s requirements were broad in<br/>\\n\\tscope due to the inherently uncertain nature of the requirements and<br/>\\n\\tthe government\\'s desire to seek out a variety of proposed solutions,<br/>\\n\\tand the agency anticipated and received wide price variances based on<br/>\\n\\ta wide range of proposed approaches and labor hours. Since many<br/>\\n\\tproposals were based on differing sets of assumptions for required<br/>\\n\\tworkloads, some proposals were not considered realistic because the<br/>\\n\\thours proposed were too low to accomplish the requirements, and other<br/>\\n\\tproposals were considered realistic for their proposed solutions but<br/>\\n\\ttheir solutions were not as comprehensive as other offerors\\'<br/>\\n\\tsolutions, the SSO concluded that the total proposed prices did not<br/>\\n\\trepresent \"real\" price differences. As a result, on a<br/>\\n\\tmodule-by-module basis, the agency compared offerors\\' proposed labor<br/>\\n\\thours, loaded labor rates, and other direct costs to see if a<br/>\\n\\tsimilarity in these breakdowns would support price reasonableness.<br/>\\n\\tThe SSO ultimately concluded that, given their widely disparate<br/>\\n\\tapproaches and levels of comprehensiveness, none of the offerors<br/>\\n\\tdemonstrated an approach that would offer a comparable technical<br/>\\n\\tsolution at a much lower price as compared to any other offeror. /1/<br/>\\n\\tSSO Decision at 8.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tUnder Module 1, NCS\\'s proposal was rated outstanding under both<br/>\\n\\ttechnical approach subfactors and overall, with a proposed price of<br/>\\n\\t$10,183,748 using 68,121 hours. RCI\\'s proposal was rated outstanding<br/>\\n\\tunder the past performance subfactor, acceptable under the<br/>\\n\\tmanagement/technical approach subfactor, and outstanding overall, with<br/>\\n\\ta proposed price of $[DELETED] using [DELETED] hours. Under Module 3,<br/>\\n\\tboth proposals were rated outstanding under both technical approach<br/>\\n\\tsubfactors and overall. The agency evaluated NCS\\'s proposed price at<br/>\\n\\t$36,919,512 using 456,005 hours, and RCI\\'s proposed price at<br/>\\n\\t$[DELETED] using [DELETED] hours. /2/ Under Module 4, both proposals<br/>\\n\\twere rated outstanding under both technical approach subfactors and<br/>\\n\\toverall. NCS\\'s proposed price was $29,065,166 using 326,480 hours and<br/>\\n\\tRCI\\'s proposed price was $[DELETED] using [DELETED] hours.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe SSO\\'s source selection decision set forth the basis for his<br/>\\n\\tconclusions regarding price reasonableness, as discussed above, and<br/>\\n\\tcompiled a table of the \"pros\" and \"cons\" of each offeror\\'s technical<br/>\\n\\tproposal, on a module-by-module basis. In his trade-off analyses for<br/>\\n\\teach module, the SSO found that NCS had the best technical proposal<br/>\\n\\tand clearly demonstrated the capability to perform the requirements in<br/>\\n\\tthe necessary time frame; other offerors also had strong technical<br/>\\n\\tproposals, but had identified weaknesses. The SSO found that NCS\\'s<br/>\\n\\thigher price was indicative of its comprehensive technical approach<br/>\\n\\tand realistic workload assumptions, whereas other offerors\\' lower<br/>\\n\\tproposed prices were the result of either unrealistic assumptions or a<br/>\\n\\tless comprehensive approach. The SSO concluded that, if consistent<br/>\\n\\tapproaches and workload assumptions were used, no offeror proposed an<br/>\\n\\tapproach that indicated the government would ultimately pay less than<br/>\\n\\tit would to any other offeror, and found that NCS\\'s approach provided<br/>\\n\\tthe clearest assurance it could accomplish the requirements in the<br/>\\n\\tcongressionally-mandated timeframes. SSO Decision at 8-10. NCS was<br/>\\n\\tawarded a contract for all four modules.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAfter RCI filed these protests challenging the agency\\'s evaluation of<br/>\\n\\tproposals and source selection decisions, the agency determined that<br/>\\n\\tcontract performance was in the best interests of the United States<br/>\\n\\tand that urgent and compelling circumstances existed which<br/>\\n\\tsignificantly affected the interests of the United States, and which<br/>\\n\\twould not permit waiting for our decision, and executed an override of<br/>\\n\\tthe statutory stay of performance of the contract. See 31 U.S.C. Sec.<br/>\\n\\t3553(d)(3)(C)(i) (2000).</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe first address the contention made by the agency and NCS that our<br/>\\n\\tOffice lacks jurisdiction to hear this protest. In this regard, under<br/>\\n\\tthe Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (CICA), our Office has<br/>\\n\\tjurisdiction to resolve bid protests concerning solicitations and<br/>\\n\\tcontract awards that are issued \"by a Federal agency.\" 31 U.S.C. Sec.<br/>\\n\\t3551(1)(A) (1994). CICA provides that the term \"Federal agency\" has<br/>\\n\\tthe meaning given the term by section 3 of the Federal Property and<br/>\\n\\tAdministrative Services Act of 1949, 40 U.S.C. Sec. 472 (1994). That<br/>\\n\\tAct defines the term \"Federal agency\" as including any executive<br/>\\n\\tagency, and defines the term \"executive agency\" as including any<br/>\\n\\texecutive department or independent establishment in the executive<br/>\\n\\tbranch of the government. 40 U.S.C. Sec. 472(a),(b). Neither the<br/>\\n\\tagency nor NCS disputes that the TSA is a federal agency for purposes<br/>\\n\\tof CICA.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tInstead, both the agency and NCS argue that the ATSA provides that TSA<br/>\\n\\tprocurements are subject to the Federal Aviation Administration\\'s<br/>\\n\\t(FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) under 49 U.S.C. Sec.<br/>\\n\\t40110(d) (1998 Supp. IV), and that 49 U.S.C. Sec. 40110(d)(2)(F)<br/>\\n\\tspecifically exempts procurements subject to the AMS from our bid<br/>\\n\\tprotest jurisdiction. In support of their position, the agency and<br/>\\n\\tNCS rely on section 101(o) of the ATSA:</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t(o) ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.--The acquisition management system<br/>\\n\\testablished by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation<br/>\\n\\tAdministration under section 40110 shall apply to acquisitions of<br/>\\n\\tequipment, supplies, and materials by the Transportation Security<br/>\\n\\tAdministration, or, subject to the requirements of such section, the<br/>\\n\\tUnder Secretary may make such modifications to the acquisition<br/>\\n\\tmanagement system with respect to such acquisitions of equipment,<br/>\\n\\tsupplies, and materials as the Under Secretary considers appropriate,<br/>\\n\\tsuch as adopting aspects of other acquisition management systems of<br/>\\n\\tthe Department of Transportation.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhile 49 U.S.C. Sec. 40110(d)(2)(F) does exempt procurements subject<br/>\\n\\tto the AMS from our bid protest jurisdiction, /3/ this provision of<br/>\\n\\tthe ATSA unambiguously limits the application of the AMS to the TSA\\'s<br/>\\n\\tacquisitions of \"equipment, supplies, and materials.\" The procurement<br/>\\n\\tat issue here is not an acquisition of \"equipment, supplies, and<br/>\\n\\tmaterials\" but, rather, an acquisition of services. In matters<br/>\\n\\tconcerning the interpretation of a statute, the first question is<br/>\\n\\twhether the statutory language provides an unambiguous expression of<br/>\\n\\tthe intent of the Congress. If it does, the matter ends there, for<br/>\\n\\tthe unambiguous intent of the Congress must be given effect. Chevron<br/>\\n\\tU.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43<br/>\\n\\t(1984).</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe find that the statutory language at issue here unambiguously limits<br/>\\n\\tthe application of the AMS to the TSA\\'s acquisitions of \"equipment,<br/>\\n\\tsupplies, and materials,\" and end our inquiry by concluding that<br/>\\n\\tneither this nor any other provision of the ATSA exempts the TSA\\'s<br/>\\n\\tacquisitions of services from our bid protest jurisdiction.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe do not agree with NCS that, in drafting the ATSA, the Congress<br/>\\n\\tsimply tracked the language of the statute it previously used to<br/>\\n\\tpermit the FAA Administrator to develop and implement the AMS, and<br/>\\n\\tintended to make the same language applicable to the TSA. The<br/>\\n\\tstatutory authority for the AMS is couched in inclusive terms,<br/>\\n\\tdirecting the FAA Administrator to develop and implement an<br/>\\n\\tacquisition management system that \"addresses the unique needs of the<br/>\\n\\tagency and, at a minimum, provides for more timely and cost-effective<br/>\\n\\tacquisitions of equipment and materials.\" Pub. L. No. 104-50, Sec.<br/>\\n\\t348(a), 109 Stat. 436, 460 (1995), codified at 49 U.S.C. Sec.<br/>\\n\\t40110(d). In contrast, the language in the ATSA is a clear limitation<br/>\\n\\ton the applicability of the AMS to the TSA\\'s acquisitions of<br/>\\n\\t\"equipment, supplies, and materials.\" In any event, neither the ATSA<br/>\\n\\tnor its legislative history evidence congressional intent to simply<br/>\\n\\tgrant to the TSA the same procurement authority as was previously<br/>\\n\\tgranted to the FAA. On the contrary, while the conference report on<br/>\\n\\tthe ATSA indicates that the House amendment had provided that the TSA<br/>\\n\\twould have the \"same procurement and personnel authority as the FAA,\"<br/>\\n\\tH.R. Conf. Report No. 107-296, at 54 (2001), the conference substitute<br/>\\n\\tcontains no such language. Id. We recognize that the practical<br/>\\n\\teffect of our interpretation of this provision is that protests of TSA<br/>\\n\\tacquisitions may take two different tracks depending upon the nature<br/>\\n\\tof the acquisition, but conclude that this interpretation is mandated<br/>\\n\\tby the specific language of the statute. Unless the Congress changes<br/>\\n\\tthe statutory language, our Office will consider protests of TSA<br/>\\n\\tacquisitions of services.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTurning to the merits of the protests, RCI argues that various aspects<br/>\\n\\tof the evaluation of its own proposal and of the NCS proposal, as well<br/>\\n\\tas the source selection decisions flowing from those evaluations, are<br/>\\n\\tunreasonable.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe evaluation of technical proposals is primarily the responsibility<br/>\\n\\tof the contracting agency, and our Office does not make an independent<br/>\\n\\tevaluation of their merits. Rather, we examine the agency\\'s<br/>\\n\\tevaluation to ensure that it is reasonable and consistent with the<br/>\\n\\tstated evaluation criteria and with applicable procurement statutes<br/>\\n\\tand regulations. The protester bears the burden of showing that the<br/>\\n\\tevaluation is unreasonable, and the fact that it disagrees with the<br/>\\n\\tagency does not render the evaluation unreasonable. ESCO, Inc.,<br/>\\n\\tB-225565, Apr. 29, 1987, 87-1 CPD Para. 450 at 7. Our review of the<br/>\\n\\trecord shows that RCI has not met that burden.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tUnder Module 1, \"Posting and Applicant Intake for Security Screener<br/>\\n\\tand Law Enforcement Job Applications and Additional Postings as<br/>\\n\\tRequired,\" offerors were required to implement an automated process to<br/>\\n\\tdistinguish qualified candidates from unqualified candidates,<br/>\\n\\tdetermine the highest band qualification for qualified candidates, and<br/>\\n\\tplace candidates on appropriate referral lists. NCS\\'s proposal was<br/>\\n\\trated outstanding under both technical approach subfactors and<br/>\\n\\toverall. RCI\\'s proposal was rated outstanding under the past<br/>\\n\\tperformance subfactor, acceptable under the management/technical<br/>\\n\\tapproach subfactor, and outstanding overall.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe SSO considered the NCS proposal to have 11 \"pros\" and no \"cons,\"<br/>\\n\\tand considered the RCI proposal to have 7 \"pros\" and 2 \"cons\"--its<br/>\\n\\tfailure to address in greater detail the technology that would drive<br/>\\n\\tits database system, and the fact that its technical approach was more<br/>\\n\\tof a process than an execution plan. /4/ Since several other offerors<br/>\\n\\thad higher technical ratings and lower pricing than RCI, the SSO did<br/>\\n\\tnot consider RCI\\'s proposal in his tradeoff decision. RCI argues that<br/>\\n\\tits acceptable rating under the technical/management approach<br/>\\n\\tsubfactor was unwarranted.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tRCI contends that there was no RFP requirement to describe the<br/>\\n\\ttechnical configuration and specifications for the computer system<br/>\\n\\tthat would house the candidate management system, and no RFP<br/>\\n\\trequirement that this database be designed to run on TSA computers.<br/>\\n\\tAs the agency explains, however, its concern that RCI failed to<br/>\\n\\taddress in detail the technology that would drive its database system<br/>\\n\\twas not with systems architecture, but with RCI\\'s failure to include<br/>\\n\\tdetails about the functional capabilities of its database and how it<br/>\\n\\twould work with existing government systems. /5/ RCI\\'s objection that<br/>\\n\\tthe agency is not procuring the database system and does not need this<br/>\\n\\tdetail does not address the agency\\'s reasonable concern that it could<br/>\\n\\tnot ascertain RCI\\'s ability to meet the requirements using its<br/>\\n\\tdatabase without having details about the functional capabilities of<br/>\\n\\tthat database.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs for the second \"con\" identified by the SSO, the agency explains<br/>\\n\\tthat RCI\\'s proposal showed the steps it would take to meet the<br/>\\n\\trequirements but lacked details about how its plan would be<br/>\\n\\tspecifically implemented, a failure that was exacerbated by the lack<br/>\\n\\tof a specific timeline. As a result, RCI\\'s proposal did not<br/>\\n\\tdemonstrate how it would apply sufficient resources to process the<br/>\\n\\trequired number of applicants in a timeframe that would permit<br/>\\n\\tsubsequent actions, such as assessing candidates, and hiring,<br/>\\n\\ttraining, and deploying huge numbers of personnel, to take place while<br/>\\n\\tstill ensuring that the TSA\\'s overall requirements would be met. In<br/>\\n\\tthis regard, section L.C.(2) of the RFP required offerors to provide a<br/>\\n\\tdetailed plan for managing and accomplishing each module to include<br/>\\n\\tensuring the timely delivery of services. RCI\\'s referral to various<br/>\\n\\tparts of its proposal has not persuaded us that this information<br/>\\n\\tencompasses the detail of concern to the agency and gives us no basis<br/>\\n\\tto find its conclusions unreasonable.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tRCI next argues that the SSO unreasonably selected the higher-priced<br/>\\n\\tNCS proposal over its lower-priced proposal under Module 3, \"Candidate<br/>\\n\\tSelection.\"</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe SSO\\'s tradeoff analysis shows that he found seven \"pros\" and no<br/>\\n\\t\"cons\" in NCS\\'s technical proposal, and eight \"pros\" and one \"con\" in<br/>\\n\\tRCI\\'s technical proposal--its proposal of only [DELETED] candidate<br/>\\n\\tassessment sites. The agency evaluated NCS\\'s proposed price as<br/>\\n\\t$36,919,512, using 456,005 hours, and RCI\\'s proposed price as<br/>\\n\\t$[DELETED] using [DELETED] hours.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn response to the protests, the SSO provided a declaration in which<br/>\\n\\the elaborated on his source selection decision. /6/ The SSO explained<br/>\\n\\tthat while NCS\\'s proposal was evaluated as having no technical<br/>\\n\\tweaknesses, RCI\\'s proposal was evaluated as having one weakness he<br/>\\n\\tconsidered very significant: it was not clear to him that RCI\\'s<br/>\\n\\tproposal of only [DELETED] candidate assessment sites would be<br/>\\n\\tadequate to get the job done in the required timeframe. The SSO also<br/>\\n\\tstated he had a significant concern regarding RCI\\'s price proposal<br/>\\n\\tusing only [DELETED] hours to do the work, as compared with the<br/>\\n\\t456,005 hours proposed by NCS. The SSO explained that Module 3<br/>\\n\\tincluded the interviewing process, which called for the development of<br/>\\n\\tinterviewing protocols, training interviewers, conducting and scoring<br/>\\n\\tthe interviews, making and gaining approval of salary recommendations,<br/>\\n\\textending offers of employment, negotiating offers of employment,<br/>\\n\\tprocessing the entry onto duty, and entering all relevant information<br/>\\n\\trelative to the above processes into the appropriate databases. The<br/>\\n\\tSSO\\'s conservative estimate was that, to hire 30,000 to 50,000 people,<br/>\\n\\tit would be necessary to conduct approximately 60,000 to 100,000<br/>\\n\\tinterviews. The SSO believed that [DELETED] hours was a severe<br/>\\n\\tunderestimate of the hours that would ultimately be required to simply<br/>\\n\\tperform the interviews, let alone to perform the rest of the required<br/>\\n\\twork. Considering both of his concerns with RCI\\'s proposal, the SSO<br/>\\n\\tdetermined that NCS\\'s significant strengths and lack of weaknesses<br/>\\n\\tmerited its additional cost.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tRCI\\'s argument that the SSO failed to consider whether NCS\\'s proposal<br/>\\n\\tto perform the requirements using 456,005 hours was excessive compared<br/>\\n\\twith its own proposal to perform the requirements using [DELETED]<br/>\\n\\thours is undermined by its concession that it actually intended to<br/>\\n\\tpropose a price of $[DELETED] for Module 3 using [DELETED] hours. /7/<br/>\\n\\tIn our view, this confirms the SSO\\'s concern that RCI\\'s proposed hours<br/>\\n\\tand resulting price were unrealistic to perform the required tasks.<br/>\\n\\tMoreover, in light of the large number of expected candidates and<br/>\\n\\ttheir geographic dispersion, RCI has given us no basis to discount the<br/>\\n\\tSSO\\'s concern regarding the sufficiency of RCI\\'s proposal of only<br/>\\n\\t[DELETED] candidate assessment sites.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tModule 4, \"Day-to-Day Servicing,\" included all facets of human<br/>\\n\\tresources services to include maintenance of official personnel<br/>\\n\\tfolders, reporting to the office of personnel management central<br/>\\n\\tpersonnel data file, staffing, recruitment,<br/>\\n\\tcompensation/classification, employee relations, labor relations,<br/>\\n\\tbenefits and retirement counseling, record keeping and maintenance,<br/>\\n\\toffice of workers\\' compensation tasks, and other requirements.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBoth proposals were rated outstanding under both technical approach<br/>\\n\\tsubfactors and overall. NCS proposed a price of $29,065,166 with<br/>\\n\\t326,480 hours and RCI $[DELETED] with [DELETED] hours. The SSO\\'s<br/>\\n\\ttradeoff analysis shows that he found NCS had six \"pros\" and one<br/>\\n\\t\"con\"--it was unclear whether the firm had provided labor relations or<br/>\\n\\tbenefit services to other clients. The SSO found that RCI\\'s proposal<br/>\\n\\thad seven \"pros\" and two \"cons\"--the proposal assumed centralized<br/>\\n\\tprocessing and none of its past/current projects were of the size and<br/>\\n\\tscope of this project.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn his post-protest declaration, the SSO explained why he found the<br/>\\n\\tNCS proposal to be superior. The SSO did not believe that the one<br/>\\n\\tweakness in the NCS proposal, its failure to demonstrate that it had<br/>\\n\\tprovided labor relations or benefits support to other customers,<br/>\\n\\tthreatened the firm\\'s ability to successfully complete the project in<br/>\\n\\tthe time mandated by the Congress, and did not consider this weakness<br/>\\n\\tsignificant. On the other hand, RCI\\'s proposal had two weaknesses.<br/>\\n\\tWhile the SSO questioned whether RCI\\'s assumption that there would be<br/>\\n\\tcentralized processing was a good assumption, he considered RCI\\'s<br/>\\n\\tsecond weakness, its failure to demonstrate that any of its<br/>\\n\\tpast/current projects met the TSA requirements in size and scope, to<br/>\\n\\tbe much more significant. He considered the fact that RCI had never<br/>\\n\\tundertaken a project of this size and scope before to be a very<br/>\\n\\tsignificant weakness that could threaten its ability to complete the<br/>\\n\\tproject within the mandated timeframes, and contrasted this<br/>\\n\\tsignificant weakness with the significant strengths in the NCS<br/>\\n\\tproposal. He noted that the NCS proposal was credited with a<br/>\\n\\twell-prepared, thoughtful, and creative plan and considerable<br/>\\n\\tpractical experience, and stated that the NCS proposal indicated it<br/>\\n\\twas currently maintaining 30,000 personnel folders on other projects.<br/>\\n\\tHe concluded that this reflected favorably on the firm\\'s ability to<br/>\\n\\tcomplete the project within the mandated timeframes.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tRCI first contends that the SSO failed to adequately consider NCS\\'s<br/>\\n\\tweakness regarding its lack of labor relations and benefits to other<br/>\\n\\tcustomers. We do not agree. As the agency explains, the purpose of<br/>\\n\\tthis procurement is to assist the TSA in finding, evaluating, and<br/>\\n\\thiring an enormous number of passenger screeners and law enforcement<br/>\\n\\tofficers to be deployed at 429 airports nationwide in less than one<br/>\\n\\tyear. To accomplish this task, certain skills are required and, as<br/>\\n\\tthe agency explains, some are more important than others. At the<br/>\\n\\toutset of the TSA\\'s existence, the 10-month period covered by this<br/>\\n\\tcontract, the agency believes there will be little need for labor<br/>\\n\\trelations experience and the only significant role played by human<br/>\\n\\tresources regarding benefits concerns retirement benefits, which<br/>\\n\\tshould not be an issue during this short-lived contract. While RCI<br/>\\n\\tobjects that these are just hypotheses on the part of the agency, we<br/>\\n\\tfind them reasonable justifications in support of the agency\\'s<br/>\\n\\tconclusion.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tRCI next argues that the agency irrationally considered its assumption<br/>\\n\\tof centralized processing to be both a strength and weakness.<br/>\\n\\tHowever, as the agency cogently explains, the fact that RCI assumed<br/>\\n\\tthat there would be centralized processing was a strength in concept,<br/>\\n\\tbut was a weakness in practice because RCI did not fully and<br/>\\n\\tadequately explain how such an approach would be implemented to meet<br/>\\n\\tthe scope of the TSA\\'s requirements--the ability to provide day-to-day<br/>\\n\\tpersonnel servicing support to more than 30,000 recently hired<br/>\\n\\temployees nationwide. The agency was concerned, for example, that a<br/>\\n\\tcentralized processing facility in one time zone might not be<br/>\\n\\tavailable to provide support during the work hours of TSA personnel<br/>\\n\\tdispersed across various other time zones. RCI\\'s objection that this<br/>\\n\\tfeature of its proposal could just as easily have been a strength does<br/>\\n\\tnot address the agency\\'s concerns, which we find reasonable.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tRCI finally argues that it did have a project of the size and scope of<br/>\\n\\tthe TSA project, referring to a contract listed in its proposal under<br/>\\n\\twhich it stated that it maintained official personnel folders for<br/>\\n\\t28,000 students who passed through a training center on an annual<br/>\\n\\tbasis. As the agency explains, while 28,000 students pass through the<br/>\\n\\ttraining center each year, RCI\\'s proposal stated that there were only<br/>\\n\\tapproximately 7,000 students there at any one time, and the agency<br/>\\n\\tcould only conclude that the firm probably maintained 7,000 files at<br/>\\n\\tone time, less than one-fourth of the minimum TSA requirement of more<br/>\\n\\tthan 30,000 files. RCI\\'s response--that the successful contractor<br/>\\n\\twould begin performance by maintaining just one file and build up over<br/>\\n\\ttime--does not address the agency\\'s concern that, at some point, the<br/>\\n\\tcontractor will be maintaining approximately 30,000 files, and its<br/>\\n\\tconclusion that it could not ascertain that RCI had experience on that<br/>\\n\\tscale.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSource selection officials have broad discretion in determining the<br/>\\n\\tmanner and extent to which they will make use of the technical and<br/>\\n\\tprice evaluation results, and their judgments are governed only by the<br/>\\n\\ttests of rationality and consistency with the stated evaluation<br/>\\n\\tcriteria. Chemical Demilitarization Assocs., B-277700, Nov. 13, 1997,<br/>\\n\\t98-1 CPD Para. 171 at 6. Where, as here, the RFP allows for a<br/>\\n\\tprice-technical tradeoff, the selection official retains discretion to<br/>\\n\\tselect a higher-priced but also technically superior submission, if<br/>\\n\\tdoing so is in the government\\'s best interest and is consistent with<br/>\\n\\tthe solicitation\\'s stated evaluation and source selection scheme. 4-D<br/>\\n\\tNeuroimaging, B-286155.2, B-286155.3, Oct. 10, 2001, 2001 CPD Para.<br/>\\n\\t183 at 10. Here, technical factors were to outweigh price, and past<br/>\\n\\tperformance was the most important technical/management subfactor.<br/>\\n\\tThe SSO found that NCS submitted the superior proposal for each<br/>\\n\\tmodule, and that its higher price was indicative of its comprehensive<br/>\\n\\ttechnical approach and realistic workload assumptions. He also<br/>\\n\\tconsidered that the danger of selecting an inferior but less expensive<br/>\\n\\toffer involved accepting a greater risk that the project might not be<br/>\\n\\taccomplished as well or as timely as required, and the fact that, in<br/>\\n\\teither case, the result would be to increase the risk to the United<br/>\\n\\tStates of a successful terrorist attack. SSO Declaration at 2. In<br/>\\n\\tother words, the SSO was aware of the technical advantages of NCS\\'s<br/>\\n\\tproposal, and specifically determined that those advantages were worth<br/>\\n\\tNCS\\'s higher price. This is all that is required for a proper<br/>\\n\\ttradeoff, and the fact that RCI believes the price premium is too<br/>\\n\\tgreat is not sufficient to establish that the SSO\\'s determination was<br/>\\n\\tunreasonable. Id. at 11; General Servs. Eng\\'g, Inc., B-245458,<br/>\\n\\tJan. 9, 1992, 92-1 CPD Para. 44 at 11.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe protests are denied.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnthony H. Gamboa<br/>\\n\\tGeneral Counsel</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t\\xa0</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t1. RCI\\'s allegation that the agency failed to conduct an adequate price reasonableness evaluation is unpersuasive. The government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to ensure a fair and reasonable price, including the comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation; normally, adequate price competition establishes price reasonableness. FAR Sec. 15.404-1(b)(2)(i). The agency recognized that offerors\\' differing assumptions and approaches might diminish the reliability of their proposed prices for purposes of comparison, and went on to compare their proposed rates and other direct costs. The depth of an agency\\'s price analysis is a matter within the sound exercise of the agency\\'s discretion, see HSG Philipp Holzmann Technischer Servs. GmbH, B-289607, Mar. 22, 2002, 2002 CPD Para. 67 at 6, and RCI has given us no basis to question the adequacy of the agency\\'s price reasonableness determination. As for RCI\\'s contention that the agency failed to conduct a cost realism analysis, where, as here, a solicitation provides for the award of a time-and-materials contract with fixed-price burdened labor rates, there is no requirement that the agency conduct a cost realism analysis in the absence of a solicitation provision requiring such an analysis. See General Atomics, B-287348, B-287348.2, June 11, 2001, 2001 CPD Para. 169 at 7; ENMAX Corp., B-281965, May 12, 1999, 99-1 CPD Para. 102 at 10.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t2. As discussed below, RCI\\'s evaluated price for Module 3 was neither the price it actually proposed nor the price it intended to propose.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t3. Section 40110(d)(2) lists provisions of federal acquisition law that shall not apply to the acquisition management system; one of these is \"Subchapter V of chapter 35 of title 31, relating to the procurement protest system.\" 49 U.S.C. Sec. 40110(d)(2)(F).</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t4. The technical evaluation team identified separate weaknesses for both offerors regarding a lack of a detailed timeline, but the SSO did not consider this to be a separate \"con\" for either proposal.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t5. The RFP stated that \"[i]nteroperable database capability is required to capture, assess, link, and report information used to prioritize local hiring, capture data for trend analysis, and integrate this data with the global management of an applicant/candidate/new hire database and feed TSA [human resources] systems,\" and offerors were required to \"ensure that all data capture can be linked, integrated and/or imported into the [DOT] [human resource] systems.\" RFP Secs. C.2.0.B, D.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t6. Notwithstanding RCI\\'s apparent request that we accord the SSO\\'s post-protest explanation little weight, such explanations that provide a detailed rationale for contemporaneous conclusions, as is the case here, simply fill in previously recorded details, and will generally be considered in our review of the rationality of selection decisions, so long as those explanations are credible and consistent with the contemporaneous record. Jason Assocs. Corp., B-278689 et al., Mar. 2, 1998, 98-1 CPD Para. 67 at 6-7.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t7. In its proposal for Module 3, RCI apparently inadvertently inserted its intended pricing for Module 2 ($21,040,322 using 96,682 hours), and vice versa. It is not clear why the agency believed that RCI\\'s proposed price for Module 3 was $18,472,266.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t* DOCUMENT FOR PUBLIC RELEASE</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe decision issued on the date below was subject to a GAO Protective Order.
